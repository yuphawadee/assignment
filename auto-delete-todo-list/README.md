- The main list displays buttons for each todo item.
- When a button is clicked, the corresponding item is moved to the Fruit or Vegetable column based on its type.

- Users can also click on any item in the side columns to move it back to the main list immediately.



## How to Use

2. Click on an item's button to move it to the appropriate column.
3. The item will automatically return after 5 seconds, or click on it to move it back instantly.
